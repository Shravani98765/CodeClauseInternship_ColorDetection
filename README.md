# CodeClauseInternship_ColorDetection

Color detection refers to a process of identifying the colors of objects or images using computer vision and other technologies.
Some applications: Image editing, robotics, and object recognition, etc.

This project is very simple. It uses OpenCV and Pandas modules of Python.

We analyze the color information in an image's pixels. The representation used in this project is an RGB color model which uses the intensity of the primary colors.

In Computer, a color value lies between 0 to 255.
That's 255 x 255 x 255 = 16581375 ways to define a color. 

We use pandas to read the data from the dataset and we use simple concepts of OpenCV to deal with images.
